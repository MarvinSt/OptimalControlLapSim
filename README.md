# OptimalControlLapSim

This repository contains an optimal control based lap time simulation for race cars implemented in Matlab using Casadi.

## Prerequisites

 * MATLAB (tested with R2018a)
 * [CasADi](https://web.casadi.org/get/) (tested with v3.5.5)


## Installation

 * Download Casadi(https://web.casadi.org/get/) for Matlab, unzip as 'casadi' in the root of the project folder

## Track Data

 * Track curvature data can be extracted from Matlab files exported from Motec, two example files are included which were recorded from Assetto Corsa
